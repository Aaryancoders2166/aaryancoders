Flash, PHP, and Java were all strong contenders for dominance. JavaScript, they might say, is a lightweight language, a toy language for doing silly little browser effects and (at best) some basic form data validation.<\/p><p>But today, JavaScript is perhaps the most important web development language. Even though most server-side development is done with one of the more \u201cconventional\u201d programming languages, just about every website uses some amount of JavaScript for \u201cfront-end\u201d functionality. Moreover, the evolution of the language itself and the standardization of browser technology has given rise to in-browser web apps powered almost entirely on JavaScript. JavaScript frameworks have thrown that trend to hyperdive.<\/p><p>Additionally, JavaScript is no longer just a front-end language. Thanks to the\u00a0Node.js\u00a0project, it is now possible to easily use JavaScript to build applications server-side as well. And with the rise of technologies such as\u00a0MongoDB\u00a0that use\u00a0<abbr title=\"JavaScript Object Notation\">JSON<\/abbr>\u00a0as a data serialization language, it is now possible to use JavaScript for an entire web application, from data storage to server-side processing to front-end UI.<\/p><p>Whatever other programming languages you use or are interested in learning, it is increasingly clear that JavaScript is the\u00a0<i>sine qua non<\/i>\u00a0of modern web development.

This was in the mid-1990s, during the height of\u00a0the browser wars, when each browser developer was attempting to win market share by creating unique features unavailable in other browsers. There was also a line of thinking during that period that browsers would be, in many ways, an extension of the operating system and general user experience. There seems to have been some thought that Netscape\u2019s browser would be part of a distributed operating system running a portable version of the Java environment. This would be complemented by a lightweight scripting language, which was officially called\u00a0<em>LiveScript<\/em>\u00a0and developed under the project code name\u00a0<em>Mocha<\/em>.<\/p><p>It isn\u2019t clear whether it was that plan, or a simple marketing ploy, but this \u201clightweight interpreted language\u201d eventually got name \u201cJavaScript,\u201d even though the language had\u00a0no real connection to Java.<\/p><p>JavaScript was added to the Netscape Navigator browser in 1996, and Microsoft quickly reverse-engineered a JavaScript implementation for their Internet Explorer browser, which they called JScript. Unfortunately, the implementations were quite different. Different approaches to HTML and what became CSS complicated matters even more, as JavaScript exists primarily to manipulate objects within the document \u2014 different document models produced different results. It was common during this period to see websites instruct their users that the site \u201cWorks Best on Netscape\u201d or \u201cWorks Best on Internet Explorer.\u201d (AOL, which eventually bought Netscape, also had an in-app browser. But nothing worked the best on it.)<\/p><p>Netscape submitted JavaScript to Ecma, as a potential international, industry-wide standard. In 1997, the standard version, called \u201cECMAScript\u201d was released. There have been a number of subsequent version releases since then. Ecma, and not Netscape, now determines the course of the language.<\/p><p>Thanks to a general trend toward browser standardization that began in the early 2000s, and was largely complete by the middle of the 2010s, most browsers implement ECMAScript (and the HTML Document Object Model) in largely similar ways. Today, you can be fairly confident that a JavaScript-based application written according to widely-recognized best practices will work on all major browsers.<\/p><h3><span id=\"Language_features\">Language features<\/span><\/h3><h4><span id=\"Object_Orientation\">Object Orientation<\/span><\/h4><p>JavaScript is object-oriented. It\u2019s a little weird in this way, though; there are objects, but no classes. So many \u201cclassical\u201d object-oriented programmers often find it somewhat deficient, or would say it isn\u2019t\u00a0<em>actually<\/em>\u00a0object-oriented at all. But it is.<\/p><p>Nearly everything (excluding some primitive values) in JavaScript is an object, and can therefore have methods and accessible data. Objects are not instantiated from classes, however. They are cloned from other objects. Rather than writing a class, you would simply create a prototype object. New objects are then cloned from there, but new methods and properties can be added to the new objects as needed.<\/p><p>There are some advantages and disadvantages to this approach. One (possible) advantage is that if you just need a single instance of an object, you don\u2019t have the overhead of writing an entire class\u00a0<em>and then<\/em>\u00a0writing the code that instantiates it. Given JavaScripts primary domain (web documents) this makes a lot of sense.<\/p><p>The main disadvantage is basically philosophical in nature. In a complex application, it will certainly be the case that you would write a number of prototype objects that are note\u00a0<em>used<\/em>, but only cloned into new objects \u2014 essentially re-creating a class-based paradigm. Except the original objects are still there, as objects. There is no essential difference between them, even though they are being used in fundamentally different ways. The class-object dichotomy represents a particular (\u201cclassical,\u201d even) view of reality \u2014 abstract ideas about categories and types of things which are instantiated into real objects. JavaScript presents a messier (but, probably, more realistic) view of reality in which there are no abstract, Platonic notions; there is only this object, and this one, and this one, and so on.<\/p><pre><code class=\"JavaScript\">\nfunction car(make, model, year, color) {\n    this.make = make;\n    this.model = model;\n    this.year = year;\n    this.color = color;\n}\n\nvar codersCar = new car(\"Volkswagen\", \"Golf\", \"2008\", \"Black\")\n\n<\/code><\/pre><h4><span id=\"Structure\">Structure<\/span><\/h4><p>JavaScript, like most modern programming languages, follows the\u00a0<strong>structured programming model<\/strong>. The syntax is somewhat similar to C, with\u00a0<code>if<\/code>,\u00a0<code>else<\/code>,\u00a0<code>for<\/code>, and\u00a0<code>while<\/code>\u00a0all behaving as may be expected.<\/p><p>Unlike C, JavaScript\u00a0<em>mostly<\/em>\u00a0only\u00a0<strong>supports function-level variable scope<\/strong>. Block level scoping was added somewhat recently but (as of this writing), it is still much safer to code as if this were not present.<\/p><p>Speaking of variables,\u00a0<strong>variables in JavaScript are dynamically typed<\/strong>. This means you don\u2019t have to declare a variable and its data type (string, number, etc.) ahead of actually assigning the value to the variable. This is quite different from C, but is pretty common among other interpreted scripting languages.<\/p><p><strong>Functions in JavaScript are\u00a0first-class<\/strong>, which means that they can be passed as arguments to other functions or stored as variables. This allows (among other things) functions to be defined inside of other functions. This is used frequently in in-browser applications to cause functions to get defined at particular points. For example, in the following\u00a0jQuery\u00a0code, the inner function adjusts the\u00a0<code>target<\/code>\u00a0property of all on-page links so that they open in a new tab if they link to another domain. This function is created inside a function that is only called when the document is ready (fully loaded). This is a minor example (which happens to be used on this website), but illustrates something done frequently in JavaScript.<\/p><pre><code class=\"js\">\njQuery( document ).ready( function ( e ) {\n\n    \/\/ Open outbound links in a new window.\n    jQuery(document.links)\n        .filter(function() {\n            return this.hostname != window.location.hostname;\n        })\n        .attr('target', '_blank');\n\n});\n<\/code><\/pre><h4><span id=\"The_Event_Loop\">The Event Loop<\/span><\/h4><p>JavaScript relies on an\u00a0<strong>event loop<\/strong>\u00a0which listens for messages (such as mouse clicks, key strokes, or messages created by other object), and queues those messages for processing. Functions can be created that listen for certain messages, and are then triggered when those events happen (such as the example above, which triggers the inner function when the\u00a0<code>document ready<\/code>\u00a0event occurs).<\/p><p>This\u00a0<em>event driven architecture<\/em>\u00a0makes perfect sense for JavaScript\u2019s original (and still primary) purpose \u2014 website user interaction. It allows the application to listen for user-created, unprompted inputs. More recently, this feature has been exploited in server-side environments like\u00a0Node.js. Having a built-in event-listening system makes it (relatively) easy to build real-time applications in domains such as chat, gaming, collaboration, and dispatch.<\/p><h4><span id=\"List_of_JavaScript_Events_on_HTML_Elements\">List of JavaScript Events on HTML Elements<\/span><\/h4><p>Most of the names describe exactly when they fire.

CSS controls how everything looks. How do you use JavaScript to manipulate what is on the screen and what it looks like? To you use JavaScript to manipulate the HTML directly?<\/p><p>The answer is the DOM, or the Document Object Model. And no, you do not manipulate the HTML directly. You manipulate the DOM.<\/p><p>The DOM is the browser\u2019s own representation of a web page, based on the HTML and CSS. But the DOM is not a document, is the current, live state of page\u00a0<em>as it is displayed in the browser currently<\/em>. This means that the DOM knows things like element size, playback position and volume, which element is being clicked on or hovered over. Also, the DOM updates as it is being manipulated. So if you change the content of an element, that change is made in the DOM and reflected in the view (the browser\u2019s window).<\/p><h4><span id=\"Ajax\">Ajax<\/span><\/h4><p>JavaScript is the\u00a0<em>J<\/em>\u00a0in\u00a0<em>Ajax<\/em>, which originally stood for\u00a0<em>Asynchronous JavaScript and XML<\/em>. (XML, or Extended Markup Language, is a data serialization format. It has now largely been replaced by JSON \u2014 JavaScript Object Notation \u2014 but the name sticks because \u201cAjax\u201d sounds catchy.)<\/p><p>Ajax is something you probably use everyday. It is an application pattern wherein data is sent to or fetched from the server without the web page being refreshed. (Requests and response are not out of sync with browser refreshes or changed in URL.) This is how many web apps, like Gmail for example, work. The client-side (browser) JS application sends requests to the server and receives all the needed data or content as a JSON object (or XML document) and then uses that data to update the view.<\/p><h4><span id=\"jQuery_the_unofficial_standard_library\">jQuery, the unofficial standard library<\/span><\/h4><p>Most programming languages have a\u00a0<em>standard library<\/em>, a set of classes and\/or functions that help programmers do common, low-level programming tasks. Typically, these standard libraries come packaged with the language and are documented along with them.<\/p><p>For a number of historical reasons, JavaScript does not have a standard library. This means that in a \u201cpure\u201d JavaScript implementation, many very common tasks are needlessly verbose and complicated.<\/p><p>JQuery\u00a0is one of several JavaScript libraries which provide a wide range of basic functionality, making it easy to do common programming tasks like traversing the DOM, manipulating HTML objects and their properties, communicating with a server, and interfacing with the browser.<\/p><p>The jQuery library is extremely common, so much so that many consider it to be the\u00a0<em>de facto<\/em>\u00a0standard library for JavaScript. Understanding jQuery is an important skill for any front-end web developer.<\/p><p>Not everyone is happy with jQuery being considered the standard library, and a number of developers and teams have tried to create an alternative.
